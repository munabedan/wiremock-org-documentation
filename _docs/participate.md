WireMock exists and continues to thrive due to the efforts of over 150 contributors,
and we continue to welcome contributions to its evolution.
Regardless of your expertise and time you could dedicate, there're opportunities to participate and help the project!

## Ways to contribute

You can help make WireMock a better tool and community in a number of ways:

- Spread the word about WireMock, share your stories and contributions
- Help other WireMock users, e.g. by sharing your expertise or answering questions on community channels
- Write or improve documentation
- Raise an issue if you discover a bug
- Contribute new features, bug fixes or enhancements
- Improve WireMock user and developer experience
- Create cool artwork!

## Quick Start

We try to make contributing to WireMock easy for everyone,
and we minimize the entry bar where possible.
Right now there are now contributor license agreements or anything else that would
be an additional obstacle.

1. Join the [WireMock Slack](http://slack.wiremock.org/),
   especially the `#help-contributing` channel that is dedicated to help the newcomers.
2. Check out the _Contributing Guide_ below. It describes all ways to contribute
3. Just do it!

## Contributing Guide

Our main resource is the [Contributor Guide](https://github.com/wiremock/community/tree/main/contributing).
As well as other community materials,
we keep it on GitHub in the [wiremock/community](https://github.com/wiremock/community) so everyone can easily access and edit the materials.

Note that many repositories and areas have specialized contributor guidelines that could also help.

## Need help?

If you want to contribute in any way to WireMock itself or its ecosystem and got stuck,
do not hesitate to ask on the `#help-contributing` channel on the [WireMock Slack](http://slack.wiremock.org/).
The sole purpose of this channel is to resolve obstacles and route any questions
regarding the contributions.
From technical questions to permissions and blog post draft reviews,
any query is welcome!

Some activities like Advocacy and Documentation have their own channels on Slack,
and you can use them as well.
