## WireMock Helm Chart (Experimental)

There is an [experimental Helm Chart](https://wiremock.github.io/helm-charts/) for WireMock.
It allows deploying the official WireMock Docker images and also other charts that extend it.

## gRPC Proxy

**grpc-wiremock** is a proxy wrapper around the WireMock Standalone server that offers support
for the gRPC protocol.
It is implemented in Java and runs as a standalone proxy
that can be deployed in the same or another container.
The project is under active development, and the contributions are welcome!
